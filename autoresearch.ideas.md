# Autoresearch Ideas

## Current goal

Drive BEAM interpreter/compiler behavior toward QuickJS NIF parity on Test262, prioritizing categories where the native QuickJS path accepts the test and the BEAM paths still diverge.

## Active workload

Continue the QuickJS-accepted `built-ins/Object` slice:

```sh
AUTORESEARCH_QUICKJS_PARITY_ALL=1 AUTORESEARCH_TEST262_CATEGORY=built-ins/Object TEST262_ERROR_LIMIT=20 ./autoresearch.sh
```

Latest result:

```text
compatibility_cases=3408
compatibility_pass=3389
compatibility_failures=19
both_fail=3
interpreter_fail_compiler_pass=0
compiler_fails=16
compiler_crashes=0
compiler_errors=0
```

## Efficient loop

1. Run the active bounded slice once to identify the current failure list.
2. Pick one cluster only.
3. Reproduce with a small focused `.exs` or a single Test262 file before editing.
4. Add a focused regression test in `test/vm/...` only when the fix is semantic and stable.
5. Validate with the smallest useful commands first:
   ```sh
   mix test test/vm/object_model/proxy_test.exs --max-failures 5
   AUTORESEARCH_TEST262_CATEGORY=built-ins/Proxy TEST262_LIMIT=300 TEST262_ERROR_LIMIT=20 ./autoresearch.sh
   ```
6. Run broad checks only after a metric improvement or before committing:
   ```sh
   mix format --check-formatted
   mix reach.check
   mix test test/vm/runtime test/vm/compiler test/vm/object_model test/vm/interpreter \
     test/vm/object_refactor_semantics_test.exs test/vm/iterator_semantics_test.exs \
     test/vm/builtin_dsl_test.exs test/vm/ecma_metadata_test.exs --max-failures 5
   ```
7. Full source-built suite is periodic, not per tiny probe:
   ```sh
   QUICKBEAM_BUILD=1 mix test --max-failures 1 --timeout 120000
   ```

For `run_experiment`, use a larger checks timeout because current backpressure checks exceed 300s on this branch:

```text
checks_timeout_seconds: 900
```

## Near-term plan

### 1. Continue built-ins/Object parity

Current active slice:

```sh
AUTORESEARCH_QUICKJS_PARITY_ALL=1 AUTORESEARCH_TEST262_CATEGORY=built-ins/Object TEST262_ERROR_LIMIT=20 ./autoresearch.sh
```

Latest result:

```text
compatibility_cases=3408
compatibility_pass=3389
compatibility_failures=19
both_fail=3
compiler_fails=16
interpreter_fail_compiler_pass=0
```

Recent kept fixes reduced the slice from 52 to 19 failures:

- `Object.defineProperties` now collects descriptor keys through ordinary internal own-key/enumerability semantics for builtin object-like values.
- Error instance `Symbol.toStringTag` descriptors are hidden/non-enumerable.
- Object own-key ordering keeps symbols in chronological order after string keys.
- Date prototype virtual method deletes are remembered for property-helper configurability checks.
- `Object.entries` re-checks enumerability immediately before each getter read.
- RegExp assignment-created own properties use enumerable data descriptors.
- `Object.fromEntries` does not call `return` when `next()` itself returns a non-object.
- `Object.values` re-checks enumerability immediately before each getter read.
- `Object.prototype` method arities are declared for `hasOwnProperty`, `isPrototypeOf`, and `propertyIsEnumerable`.
- Error instance `Symbol.toStringTag` remains hidden/non-enumerable but is writable for assignment overrides.
- Symbol writes on shape-backed objects and array named properties preserve chronological own-key order.

Promising current clusters:

- compiler-only `Object.defineProperty` failures on `arguments` objects and generic/index properties (`15.2.3.6-4-293` through `-324`); focused probes point at compiler catch/call boundaries around caught `Object.defineProperty` TypeErrors and later `verifyProperty(arguments, ...)` calls.
- both-fail non-object invalid `getOwnPropertyNames` / `getOwnPropertySymbols` side effects where captured lexical updates made before a TypeError are not visible after `assert.throws`.
- both-fail `Object.keys` arguments-object case where sequential functions with identical bodies appear to observe stale/mismatched `arguments` for `in` checks.

Tried and reverted as ineffective:

- syncing captured locals in interpreter `catch_and_dispatch` throw branches did not improve the non-object invalid count cases because compiler also fails and the captured update is deeper than the caller frame.
- avoiding stale `arguments` globals/fallback cached arguments objects did not improve `Object.keys(arguments)` or the active metric.
- preserving symbol order for object/array assignment only improved the metric when paired with descriptor result key-order storage.
- changing compiler catch handler context to `RuntimeState.current_or(ctx)` did not improve the `defineProperty(arguments)` cluster.

### 2. Completed direct eval with spread

The direct eval spread residuals were fixed by restoring `globalThis` object properties alongside persistent globals when eval assignments resolve to caller locals. Kept regression tests cover direct eval with and without spread.

Tried and reverted as ineffective:

- treating `apply_eval` operand `0` as current scope instead of subtracting one; it did not improve the metric and left the global write wrong.

### 3. Completed object-expression side effects

The previous `language/expressions/object` QuickJS-accepted slice is clean at `941/941`. The kept fix refreshes global object writes after caught calls and updates the persistent global snapshot so later var declarations do not restore stale values.

### 4. Expand category slices only when useful

Use bounded slices for focused subsystems, not broad unrelated sweeps:

```sh
AUTORESEARCH_TEST262_CATEGORY=built-ins/Object TEST262_LIMIT=1000 ./autoresearch.sh
AUTORESEARCH_TEST262_CATEGORY=built-ins/TypedArray TEST262_LIMIT=500 ./autoresearch.sh
AUTORESEARCH_TEST262_CATEGORY=language/expressions/object TEST262_LIMIT=1000 ./autoresearch.sh
AUTORESEARCH_TEST262_CATEGORY=language/expressions/call TEST262_LIMIT=1000 ./autoresearch.sh
```

Only reinitialize the experiment when changing the active workload baseline.

## Do not retry unchanged

- Broad object-model changes that bypass `InternalMethods`.
- Filename/source-string special cases.
- Full category sweeps after every small edit.
- Old stale category notes from previous Array/Object/Function/Date/etc. campaigns unless a current run reproduces them.
- QuickJS bytecode/parser parity work in this branch unless the active Test262 failure is definitely caused before BEAM execution.
